The Clip Art Sound Library is an interactive journey through visual and audio forms of clip art icons.

The Library is a collection of black and white clip art icons shown both in their visual and audio forms, with the audio being a direct translation of the raw data from the visual. The audio form of the icon is activated through hovering.
